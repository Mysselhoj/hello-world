# hello-world
My first repository

My first attempt with GitHub but not the last one. I'm interested in several languages, mainly Python, Java and JavaScript, and Machine Learning (Computer vision and Artificial Intelligence included). Right now I'm just learning the ropes in most of them, but with effort and patience I'll get better in a few years.
